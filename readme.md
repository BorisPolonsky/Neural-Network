#Neural-Network
A neural network (temporarily a perceptron) that can now approximate linear function y=Ax+b. 
###Issues:
*Bug huanted.
*Ugly structure.
*Algorithm for hidden layers to be implemented. 
*Data validation to be implemented. 
*Measures to approximate non-linear functions to be implemented.
*Other possible issues.
